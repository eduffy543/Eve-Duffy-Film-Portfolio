            <p>Growing up I had always been fascinated by films. I desperately wanted to be apart of the filmmaking process, and like most kids dreamt of being a movie star. I began acting at the age of 5 and spent a lot of time training at many different acting schools, such as BowStreet, Theatreworx, Billie Barry, and MSPA. When Covid hit I found it near impossible to get any acting work and had seen online people were making their own jobs in the form of short films. Together a friend and I made a short called "Track No. 7". The film made it into Ireland's Young Filmmaker of the year winning an Audience Award. From then on I knew; Film was it for me. Since then I have continued to work with Ireland's Young Filmmaker of the Year, as well as travel the world with film and have even began studying at Ireland's National Film School at IADT. Throughout all of the years I'm reminded by my Dad when it seems impossible to do or too far away of a dream, There Is Always a Way.</p></div>
