                <p>Directing is a passion of mine and what I enjoy most in filmmaking. I trained as an actor for nearly 10 years and am always intrigued by performance. Ensuring an actor has both the tools and a safe space to do their best work is extremely important to me as a director. A positive culture on set is a must and I firmly believe that starts with how a director conducts themselves. As of March 2025 I have directed 8 films working both in Ireland and internationally. <br><br> In 2023 I was fortunate enough to recieve funding from RTÃ‰, Screen Ireland and the Arts Council to direct "Of Mice and Dogs". This film premiered at the Dublin International Film Festival in March 2023 when I was 18, hence I was lucky enough to be the youngest ever director to have a film premiere at the festival.</p></div>

           <div style= text-align:center;> <h3>Cinematography</h3>
            <p>When I began my filmmaking journey as a crew of 1 it was essentially to be both the cinematographer and director on my projects. Nowadays I attend the National Film School at IADT where collaboration is massively encouraged through the use of crew. Cinematography is a skill I am always looking to improve upon, from learning about the technology to test shoots with my own camera. <br><br>I have worked as a cinematographer on my film "A Wake to Remember" back in 2023, as well projects at IADT such as, Max Henderickson's film "Terminal" in 2025, and Anand Aliprandi's "A Moment of Freedom" in 2024. Currently I am working as both cinematographer and director for a documentary entitled "Half Doors Half Truths".</p></div>

            <div style= text-align:center;> <h3>Editing</h3>
             <p>I have many years of experience working as an editor on short films. Typically using Davinci Resolve as my go to software, but occasionally working on Premiere Pro as well. Some of my most rewarding editing work is seen in the film "Mythical Mick" as I spent a month rotoscoping an actor by hand to create a black and white character on a saturated background. This fix allowed the story to further shine through in its visuals, and allowed me to explore new methods of colour grading.</p>
